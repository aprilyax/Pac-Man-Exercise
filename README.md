# Pac Man

<img src="PacMan1.png" width='200' />

## Description: 
In this project, pacmen are added to the screen via an on-screen button. One or more pacmen can be added. The user then clicks another button (Start Game) to animate the pacmen. The pacmen move around the screen and change direction on screen-edge detection. The project demonstrates manipulating arrays using array methods, using parameters in functions, scheduling execution based on events on a web page. 

## How to Run
Download Index and HTML files as well as four image files. Drag and drop HTML file to browser - tested on Chrome Version 91.0.4472.114. 
- Click 'Add Pacman' button to add one or more pacmen 
- Click 'Start Game' to animate pacmen

## Future Improvements
Future improvements might include the ability to alter the characteristics of the pacment (ie change color, size, speed), load different images, or a collision avoidace process amongst the pacmen.
